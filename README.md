*Hello my name is Vanessa Natasha

**MISSION**
*I am more interested as to why things are the way they are, for example why did this genetic code express something different from what it normally codes for or why is stochasticity used to elaborate cancer or apart from changes in the genetic drift of the microorganism what else could lead to the organism being resistant to the said antibiotics.
From this my mission is to be at the forefront of drug prediction, drug discovery and having a full grasp on the relationship between the effects of drugs on genetic expression.
 
 **VISION**
*My vision is to combine computational skills and biological knowledge for the purpose of experimental immunology.That at the end of this internship I will have the right skill set to come up with new hypothesis related to immune responses and drug discovery .From this be able to analyze data generated from the hypothesis and make sense of their implication.
I want to be able to pursue immunoinformatics and do research on drug prediction*
 
 **WHY BIOINFORMATICS**
 
 *WHAT TRIGGERED MY INTEREST*
 
 Having done a Bsc in Biotechnology wet-lab was compulsory, so tissue culture, DNA extraction and amplification skills  and gel electrophoresis were skills that were highlighted throughout the four years. But I would always wonder what next, will my research always be limitted to the lab, on the number of samples i extracted DNA from or was there more? I wanted something that even after extraction and sequencing could offer me the ability to analyze and draw conclusions from my data. Bioinformatics didnt limit my research it gave me the ability to progress on my research question past the lab.
 
 *WHY BIOINFORMATICS*
 
 Because bioinformatics allows me to answer foundational questions in biology. I would like to answer why to most research questions and to understand pharmocogenomics in a much broader perspective. This i can accomplish by combining genetic data and immunological data and tailor them to understand any relationship that might  be as result of the other.Bioinformatics offers me an interdisciplinary approach to all things molecular.
I want to be a wholesome scientist in that I can actually do the lab work but most importantly test my hypothesis in-silico. That before I do PCR in the lab i can actually design and optmize my primers in-silico. The options of bioinformatics are limtless this why I chose bioinformatics because i can solve problems that haven't been considered in the wet-lab. More to this I think partly because bioinformatics can be challenging in an interesting way.


*SHORT TERM VISION or GOAL*

 I have a handle on wet-lab skills since  i have done alot of practicals in the lab, my challenge is coding. I dont have alot of practice in this area and thus this is very limiting. I can come up with great research questions on various research projects the only challenge is that i would have a vague idea on the data analysis tools I would need to use to answer the questions. Hence a short term vision of mine is to be profecient in coding and data analysis. That when i have a research idea I could actualize a specific methodology on how to meet the various objectives.  Because I have taken some coding classes, i have  some basics on coding, but I need the coding that I learn to be tailored on how to handle and analyze biological data.
 
 *LONG TERM VISION OR GOAL*
 
 My longterm goal is to use bioinformatics for machine learning, drug design and drug prediction. I hope that i will be well vast iin coding so as to come up with algorithims tailored for specific research questions .

## PROJECT MISSION AND SUMMARY

*My vision is to combine computational skills and biological knowledge for the purpose of experimental immunology.That at the end of this internship I will have the right skill set to come up with new hypothesis related to immune responses and drug discovery .From this be able to analyze data generated from the hypothesis and make sense of their implication*

### MILESTONES
1. FIRST MILESTONE- 2022
To be vast in data analysis skills and basic coding skills needed for immunological analysis. To accomplish this first milestone I did some beginner coding in R and python to have an idea on coding I also got a bioinformatics internship at ICIPE which I am hoping will catapult my coding and data analysis skills.
Some of the activites  that I will do to enable me accomplish this milestone;-

- Be active in coding projects
- Test out the accuracy of my codes by asking my supervisors to verify and assist where necessarry
- Working in colaboration with like minded individuals to learn from them
- Take part in any necessary coding classes

2. SECOND MILESTONE-2023
 Pursue an Msc in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.Bioinformatics because I want to have a full grasp of biological data analysis and computational biology for the purpose of developing models and algorithims that can be used on different immunological hypotheses.
 
 

 
 _Below is my daily journal during my internship_
 
 **12th of July**
 
 On the first day we got an introduction on github and linux to some extent.
 
 # GITHUB
 Github is a code hosting platform for version control and colaboration
 It enables the working and access to your codes from anywhere
 >On github markdown is used for writing and formatting synatx
 Various keyboard symbols are used to accomplish this.

## Forking 
Forking is a means that allows you to make changes to the repository that you manage.It lets you make changes without affecting the original work
>Updates can be fetched or submitted to the original repo with a pull request this allows your changes to be actualized to the original repo.
A fork makes your own copy of a repo in remote location. This is different from clonning that makes a local copy of your repo not your own copy.

*A pull request is a request to merge one or more commits into a different branch .A commit is a discrete change to one or more files*
> Here's a link to my first fork https://github.com/Natasha-Adongo/MyFirstFork/compare/Natasha-Adongo-patch-1


**13th July**

We explored what bioinformatics means to each of us at individual level.
From this discussion I answered why chose bioinformatics, my short term goals and long term goals. We did this to get a sense of what we expect from the internship.

# Open science and Data Management in Bioinformatics #
**Open Science**
Practice of science that others can colaborate and contribute to.
This is for reuse, redistribution and reproduction.
Open access is an aspect of open science.

*Jornals with open access and open reviews* 

 - F1000 research
 
 - Elife
  
 - AAS open access journal
 
 *Open Science tools*
 
 Open science tools are tools that can be used in building and delivering open science
 - Git and Github
 - Rmarkdown
 - Jupyter notebooks
 - Zenodo

*Data repositories* these are used for storing data and also  allow open access
- Zendo
- Figshare  They are mostly linked to open research
- Dryad
- Dataverse


*Data management plan*

This gives a decription on the data that will be accessible to everyone 

- Type of data
- Standards - formats and metadata
- Access policies 
- Provisions for archiving and preservation

*FAIR AND CARE data principles*


**Organising your sequencing Project**
- Your data has to be tidy 
- Data storage - HDDS, Servers, Cloud, OSF


## Open Science tools in Bioinformatics ##
* Quality project this is a simple tools for wet-lab scientist 
* Common workflow language
* nextflow
* Docker
* Singularity 
* Synapse - R, Python, Bash and Linux

# Below is a link on the open science taxonomies  ##

https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/themes/fosterstrap/images/taxonomies/os_taxonomy.png

** aspects of open data you need to understand **
### Gold  route ###

Open access is delivered by publishing an article in a journal. The journal maybe pure open access or hybrid open access(this means it is subscription based

#### Green route ####

The green route open access is delivered by self-archiving(depositing an output) into a repository, these can be either institutional or subject repos
