# Natasha
*Hello my name is Vanessa Natasha and this will be a journal of sorts throughout my internship I am more interested as to why things are the way they are, for example why did this genetic code express something different from what it normally codes for or why is stochasticity used to elaborate cancer or apart from changes in the genetic drift of the microorganism what else could lead to the organism being resistant to the said antibiotics.*
 
 
 **12th of July**
 On the first day we got an introduction on github and linux to some extent.
 
 #GITHUB
 Github is a code hosting platform for version control and colaboration
 It enables the working and access to your codes from anywhere
 >On github markdown is used for writing and formatting synatx
 Various keyboard symbols are used to accomplish this.

##Forking 
Forking is a means that allows you to make changes to the repository that you manage.It lets you make changes without affecting the original work
>Updates can be fetched or submitted to the original repo with a pull request this allows your changes to be actualized to the original repo.
A fork makes your own copy of a repo in remote location. This is different from clonning that makes a local copy of your repo not your own copy.

*A pull request is a request to merge one or more commits into a different branch .A commit is a discrete change to one or more files*
