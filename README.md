*Hello my name is Vanessa Natasha

**MISSION**
*I am more interested as to why things are the way they are, for example why did this genetic code express something different from what it normally codes for or why is stochasticity used to elaborate cancer or apart from changes in the genetic drift of the microorganism what else could lead to the organism being resistant to the said antibiotics.*
 
 **VISION**
*My vision is to combine computational skills and biological knowledge for the purpose of experimental immunology.That at the end of this internship I will have the right skill set to come up with new hypothesis related to immune responses and drug discovery .From this be able to analyze data generated from the hypothesis and make sense of their implication.
I want to be able to pursue immunoinformatics and do research on drug prediction*

###MILESTONES
1. FIRST MILESTONE- 2022
To be vast in data analysis skills and basic coding skills needed for immunological analysis. To accomplish this first milestone I did some beginner coding in R and python to have an idea on coding I also got a bioinformatics internship at ICIPE which I am hoping will catapult my coding and data analysis skills.
Some of the activites  that I will do to enable me accomplish this milestone;-

- Be active in coding projects
- Test out the accuracy of my codes by asking my supervisors to verify and assist where necessarry
- Working in colaboration with like minded individuals to learn from them
- Take part in any necessary coding classes

2. SECOND MILESTONE-2023
 Pursue an Msc in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.Bioinformatics because I want to have a full grasp of biological data analysis and computational biology for the purpose of developing models and algorithims that can be used on different immunological hypotheses.
 
 

 
 _Below is my daily journal during my internship_
 
 **12th of July**
 On the first day we got an introduction on github and linux to some extent.
 
 #GITHUB
 Github is a code hosting platform for version control and colaboration
 It enables the working and access to your codes from anywhere
 >On github markdown is used for writing and formatting synatx
 Various keyboard symbols are used to accomplish this.

##Forking 
Forking is a means that allows you to make changes to the repository that you manage.It lets you make changes without affecting the original work
>Updates can be fetched or submitted to the original repo with a pull request this allows your changes to be actualized to the original repo.
A fork makes your own copy of a repo in remote location. This is different from clonning that makes a local copy of your repo not your own copy.

*A pull request is a request to merge one or more commits into a different branch .A commit is a discrete change to one or more files*
